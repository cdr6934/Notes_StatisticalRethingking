This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Prior Predictive Simulation
```{r}
m5_1 <- quap(alist( 
  D ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), 
  mu <- a + bA * A, 
  a ~ dnorm(0, 0.2), 
  bA ~ dnorm(0,0.5), 
  sigma ~ dexp(1)), data = d)
```

```{r}
set.seed(10)
prior <- extract.prior(m5_1)
mu <- link(m5_1, post = prior, data = list(A=c(2,2)))
plot(NULL, xlim = c(-2,2), ylim=c(2,2))
for (i in 1:50) lines(c(-2,2), mu[i,], col=col.alpha("black,0.4"))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



Milk Fat Content in Primates vs. Neocortex Activity
```{r}
data(milk)
d <- milk
pairs(~kcal.per.g + log(mass) + neocortex.perc, data =d )
```


```{r}
summary(d)
```

```{r}
m5_7 <- quap(alist( 
  K ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), 
  mu <- a  +bN*N, bM*M, 
  a ~ dnorm(0,0.2), 
  bN ~ dnorm(0, 0.5), 
  bM ~ dnorm(0,0.5), 
  sigma ~ dexp(1)), 
  data = d)
precis(m5_7)
```
